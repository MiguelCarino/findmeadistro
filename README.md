# **Find Me A Distro**
[Find Me A Distro]("https://distro.moe"), or **FMAD** for short, is a website that finds random Unix/GNU+linux distributions. This is a fork from Find Me A Linux Distro ("https://github.com/KripC2160/findmealinuxdistro") by KripC2160 ("https://github.com/KripC2160/").

These distributions may include familiar options, remixes, country exclusives, and more. FMAD is seeking additional distributions, so if you have suggestions, please submit them in the [issues](https://github.com/MiguelCarino/findmeadistro/issues). Currently, the focus is on Linux distributions primarily for x86_64 workstations, though server images and other architectures may be included. Feedback is welcome.
